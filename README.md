# Pickleball Court Queueing System
By Justin Fletcher, Josue Hernandez, Max Gambino, and Casey Pietrusewicz 

Built for WPI CS 4241 (Webware) Final Project in A Term 2026

You can find a video demonstration [here](https://youtu.be/hR5E4vDZ-kA) and here is the [link](https://pickleball-queueing-system-3e4e.onrender.com/) to our deployed website

## Description
WPI Club Pickleball has weekly practices in the rec center. There is enough space for 4 courts and 4 people per court, so a total of 16 people. Because more than 16 people show up to the practices, a queue system is necessary. 

To address this problem, we designed a web app to function as this queue system, complete with persistent state and a live-updating UI. We also have a party system so you can play with your friends. For accounts, we decided on following a similar model to the app when2meet which associates accounts with an event. We associate our accounts with a practice and when the practice ends all accounts associated with that practice are deleted. We hope after making future refinements for the WPI pickleball club to actually use our app. 


## Instructions
After going to the deployed URL, you can either create a new practice or join an existing one. We have one in the database using this code (`LNS12N`) with seeded data. The admin account for this practice has the username `admin` and the password `admin`. You can log into the seeded player accounts by using `player{number}` as the username and `pass{number}` as the password. You can also create your own account as long as it is not an existing username. 

## Tech Stack
- React for front-end framework and components
- TypeScript as scripting language
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Express for back-end server
- MongoDB for storing data
- WS for WebSockets, used for live communication between different instances of the website
- Postman for testing API endpoints

## Challenges
One particularly difficult aspect of this project was the database design and endpoints. We went through several iterations designing endpoints and working with MongoDB. Our server file grew to be very big and has over 15 custom endpoints. We also found the websockets to be challenging but very rewarding. It was awesome to see live state updates happen in different browsers with no action from the user. The last challenge to this project was just time management in getting everything done we wanted to get done. 

## Group Responsibilities
Justin
- Worked on backend database schema and queue endpoints
- Connected front-end to backend by implementing handlers
- Implemented party system in client side and got it working with web sockets
- Performed QA and bug fixes
- Deployed website

Josue
- Set up a Vite React TypeScript template 
- Wrote the first version of the party endpoints
    - create, leave, and enqueue parties.
    - Sent requests to join, canceled, and responded to requests.
- Started browser notifications when joining the queue

Max
- Frontend
    - Created the pages
    - Used tailwind CSS for styling
- Implemented the queue system
    - Would always try to get groups onto courts
    - Would group smaller groups together if a group of <4 is at the top of the queue
- Created a theme page with multiple themes
- Created cookies so users would stay logged in if they refreshed the page

Casey
- Initialized connection to MongoDB during creation of the express server
- Wrote the first version of the createPractice function
- Implemented websockets into the web app
-   Push state updates whenever a change occurs and broadcast to all current users/browsers
-   Wrote useQueueSocket to be able to display changes on React
-   Store practice code in localHost in case user gets disconnected
- Added a End Practice button to allow the admin to end the session
